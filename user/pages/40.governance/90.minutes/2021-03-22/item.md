### 4. Discussion & Announcements

#### Round 1
<!-- Is there much food to be washed? -->
- [zui] food to be washed? not much vegetables, we may need to get more before the next weekend
- [Thore] The voting phase for the private agreement ended yesterday with 8 support and 1 accept. Thank you :-) So when I'm coming back tomorrow I would use the private again. 
- [Janina] will there be a building month? there are visitor requests
  - [zui] proposal for building weeks for first roof (e.g. 15.-29. than a party?) and the second roof end of the summer
  - [antonin] is happy with those dates
  - [tilmann] scaffolding space is reserved for 2 months, this seems to be the worst case estimation by Antonin and Matthias?
  - [chandi] 2 weeks is not totally unrealistic, 3 weeks might be a better goal
  - [zui] needs to be discussed again
- [Nathalie] lunch team
  - [Janina] we go forward with the dynamic lunch team. please always remove your peg after eating, anybody can remove pegs in the evening
  - [Thore] Can someone put a peg tomorrow for me? So that I can eat lunch.

<!-- pause for people who haven't spoken, to think about whether they have a point -->
